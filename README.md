# Instructions

Have worked accordingly.

## Build a Flutter Web app that displays a Rive animation

- [x] Please use the Rive animation provided to you.
- [x] Create a screen that shows the animation. Underneath the animation there should be a button that toggles saying "Start" and "Stop". When you press start, the animation should start playing. When you press stop, the animation should stop playing.
- [x] After you have completed the app, host it somewhere so we can see it in action as well as sharing the GitHub repo with us.

## Bonuses

- [x] Add an intro screen that tells a story about the animation with a continue button at the bottom of the screen. When the user clicks "Continue", they should be taken to the animation screen with a fade transition.
- [ ] Add another button on the intro screen that says "Explore". When the user clicks on this button, it should take them to another screen that shows a new Rive animation. Create a pull request to add the code for this feature to your repo, but do not merge the PR.

## Deliverables:

- [x] [Link to GitHub repo](https://github.com/anubhavbagri/WebApp-with-Rive)
